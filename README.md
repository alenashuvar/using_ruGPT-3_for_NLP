# using_ruGPT-3_for_NLP
Using ruGPT-3 for solving texts classification as one of the NLP tasks.

This Notebook is a part of the project "Using ruGPT-3 for solving NLP tasks" ("Использование модели ruGPT-3 для решения задач NLP"), which was implemented as part of practical training at the HSE-NN university.

It was necessary to come up with prompts for ruGPT-3 models of different sizes so that they could correctly label one or another text (for example, the news text "Цена российской нефти для налогов осталась ниже $50 второй месяц подряд." should be labelled as "Экономика")
